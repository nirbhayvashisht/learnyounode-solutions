![learnyouode image](https://github.com/nirbhayvashisht/learnyounode-solutions/blob/main/Images/learnyounode.png)

learnyounode is a Node.js package that contains a series of workshop lessons which will teach you the basics of writing Node.js applications. The lessons start with a basic "HELLO WORLD" lesson, and then move on to more advanced exercises about dealing with synchronous & asynchronous I/O, filesystem operations, TCP and HTTP networking, events and streams.



## Installing learnyounode

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Run npm install -g learnyounode (this installs the learnyounode Node.js package globally). If this step fails, try one of the following fixes:
    * Prefix the install command with sudo: sudo npm install -g learnyounode
    
    or

    * fix your npm permissions.

1. Test that learnyounode has been installed successfully by running the command learnyounode in your terminal. This will start the learnyounode application, and you should see a blue screen similar to the one in the screenshot above.
    * (Ubuntu users) In case step 3 fails, run sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
